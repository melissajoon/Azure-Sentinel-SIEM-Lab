# 🔐 Azure Sentinel SIEM Lab – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my hands-on cybersecurity lab using **Microsoft Sentinel**.  
This project simulates a brute-force attack scenario, collects and analyzes Windows Event Logs, builds custom visualizations in Workbooks, and sets up alert rules for security operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a functional SIEM using Azure Sentinel
- Collect logs from a Windows VM (Event ID 4624, 4625, 4740, etc.)
- Detect failed and successful logins
- Create alert rules for brute-force attacks
- Visualize incidents in professional dashboards
- Document detection and response steps

---
